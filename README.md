# PokÃ©mon-like Game
Welcome to the PokÃ©mon-like Game project! This 2022 fun project is a pixel-art adventure game built using vanilla JavaScript. It features a map created with "Tiles" and vibrant pixel art created using Piskel. Inspired by Chris Courses on YouTube, this game brings the charm of classic PokÃ©mon games to the web.

## ðŸŽ® About the Game
The game allows you to explore a pixelated world, interact with characters, and encounter battles in a classic RPG-style format. Here's a breakdown of the key features and functionality:

## Features:

### Dynamic Map: The game world is mapped using tiles, which include boundaries, battle zones, and interactive characters. The map adjusts as you navigate through different areas.
### Character Interaction: Interact with NPCs (non-playable characters) and explore the game world. Each character has its own sprite and animation.
### Battle System: Enter battles when you overlap with designated battle zones. The battle system triggers an animation and audio effects, immersing you in the action.
### Responsive Movement: Move the player character using WASD keys. The character's sprite changes based on the direction of movement (up, down, left, right), and collision detection prevents movement through boundaries.
### Audio Effects: The game includes background music and sound effects to enhance the gameplay experience. Click anywhere on the screen to start the background music.
